# GenZ Vote System

**Project by Amine Ridal (w2zard)**

## Decentralized Voting System Documentation

### Overview

This is a comprehensive decentralized voting system designed for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. The system leverages blockchain technology and cryptographic principles to ensure vote integrity and voter anonymity.

### Key Features

#### 1. Blockchain-Based Architecture
- **Immutable Vote Records**: Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, making it impossible to alter or delete
- **Distributed Ledger**: Multiple nodes maintain copies of the voting record, eliminating single points of failure
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 hashing ensures vote integrity and authenticity

#### 2. Voter Authentication
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Voters can prove their eligibility without revealing their identity
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combines biometric and cryptographic key authentication
- **One-Person-One-Vote**: Cryptographic tokens prevent duplicate voting

#### 3. Privacy & Anonymity
- **Anonymous Ballots**: Voter identities are separated from their votes using cryptographic techniques
- **Mixing Networks**: Votes are shuffled through mixing nodes to prevent tracking
- **Encrypted Votes**: End-to-end encryption protects vote confidentiality

#### 4. Transparency & Auditability
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify the vote count without compromising voter privacy
- **Real-Time Results**: Vote tallies are updated automatically as votes are cast
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history available for verification

### Technical Architecture

#### System Components

1. **Voter Registration Module**
   - Identity verification system
   - Cryptographic key generation
   - Voter eligibility verification

2. **Voting Interface**
   - User-friendly web/mobile interface
   - Secure ballot submission
   - Receipt generation for verification

3. **Blockchain Network**
   - Distributed node network
   - Consensus mechanism (Proof of Authority)
   - Smart contracts for vote validation

4. **Vote Tallying System**
   - Automated counting mechanism
   - Real-time result aggregation
   - Statistical verification tools

5. **Audit & Verification Module**
   - Public ledger access
   - Vote verification tools
   - Dispute resolution system

### Security Measures

#### Cryptographic Protection
- **RSA-4096**: Asymmetric encryption for voter authentication
- **AES-256**: Symmetric encryption for vote data
- **SHA-256**: Hashing for data integrity verification
- **Digital Signatures**: Non-repudiation and authenticity

#### Attack Prevention
- **DDoS Protection**: Distributed architecture prevents service disruption
- **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Identity verification prevents fake voter creation
- **51% Attack Mitigation**: Consensus mechanism requires supermajority
- **Man-in-the-Middle Protection**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

### Voting Process Flow

1. **Registration Phase**
   - Voter registers and receives cryptographic credentials
   - Identity verified through secure channels
   - Voter added to eligibility list

2. **Authentication Phase**
   - Voter logs in using multi-factor authentication
   - System verifies voter eligibility
   - One-time voting token generated

3. **Voting Phase**
   - Voter selects candidates/options
   - Vote encrypted and signed
   - Vote submitted to blockchain network
   - Confirmation receipt generated

4. **Tallying Phase**
   - Votes aggregated from blockchain
   - Automated counting process
   - Results published on public ledger

5. **Verification Phase**
   - Voters can verify their vote was counted
   - Public can verify overall tallies
   - Audit logs available for review

### Smart Contract Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Vote {
        bytes32 voteHash;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bool counted;
    }
    
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public voteCounts;
    
    address public admin;
    bool public votingActive;
    
    event VoteCast(bytes32 indexed voteHash, uint256 timestamp);
    event VotingStatusChanged(bool active);
    
    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can perform this action");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier votingIsActive() {
        require(votingActive, "Voting is not active");
        _;
    }
    
    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
        votingActive = false;
    }
    
    function startVoting() public onlyAdmin {
        votingActive = true;
        emit VotingStatusChanged(true);
    }
    
    function endVoting() public onlyAdmin {
        votingActive = false;
        emit VotingStatusChanged(false);
    }
    
    function castVote(bytes32 _voteHash) public votingIsActive {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        voteCounts[_voteHash]++;
        
        emit VoteCast(_voteHash, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function getVoteCount(bytes32 _voteHash) public view returns (uint256) {
        return voteCounts[_voteHash];
    }
    
    function hasVoterVoted(address _voter) public view returns (bool) {
        return hasVoted[_voter];
    }
}
```
